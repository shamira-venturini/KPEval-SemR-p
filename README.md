# KPEval
This repository is a toolkit for the evaluation of Keyphrase Extraction and Keyphrase Generation systems. We provide further discussions in the paper [KPEval: Towards Fine-grained Semantic-based Evaluation of Keyphrase Extraction and Generation Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15422). The implementations will be released when the paper is formally published, and is available right now upon request (please email [Di Wu](mailto:diwu@cs.ucla.edu)).
